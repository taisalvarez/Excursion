  <h2>Bay of Bahia</h2>
  <p>Nestled on the northern end of the Isle of Caludge, this beach is
    cited as the most popular getaway for vacationers during peak summer
     months. Popular activities include scuba diving, snorkeling, and
     bird watching.</p>

  <h2>Selange Beach</h2>
  <p>Selange Beach is known for its temperate sand. Made up of ground
    coral due to thousands of years of tectonic activity, the sand
     is always cool to the touch, despite the heat. The western portion
      includes fantastic flora and fauna and many pre-Columbian ruins.</p>

  <h2>Hunt Lagoon</h2>
  <p>Known primarily for it's hidden location on Kamar Island (which
    includes swimming through an underground cave), Hunt Lagoon offers
    a peaceful respite from the tourist-laden locations found throughout
     Kamar. If possible, make a visit at night â€“ it's bioluminescent
     lagoon is like viewing fireworks in the water!</p>

  <h2>Moat Lagoon</h2>
  <p>Last, but certainly not least, is Moat Lagoon. This is one of
    the most difficult beach locations to access. The lagoon is located
     inside of a prehistoric cenote, or underground aquifer. Accessing
     it involves crossing the moat surrounding the lagoon (hence the
     name) with locals by kayak. Once there, marvel at the phenomenal
      (and endangered) quetzal bird and its golden feathers.</p>
